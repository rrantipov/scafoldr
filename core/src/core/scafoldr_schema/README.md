# Scafoldr Schema Maker

## Overview

The schema maker converts input formats (like DBML) into a standardized `ScafoldrSchema` structure that code generators can use to produce application code.

## Components

### ScafoldrSchema
The main schema object containing:
- **Project metadata**: name, description, version
- **Database schema**: tables, columns, relationships
- **Backend schema**: entities, attributes, configuration
- **Frontend schema**: coming soon

### DBML Schema Maker
Parses DBML strings and converts them into `ScafoldrSchema` objects. Handles:
- Table and column extraction
- Relationship mapping
- Entity generation for backend use

### Base Schema Maker
Abstract interface that schema makers must implement. Defines the `make_schema()` method for creating `ScafoldrSchema` instances. Currently implemented by `DbmlScafoldrSchemaMaker` (adapter pattern) to decouple architecture from DBML. Future implementations could include `MysqlScafoldrSchemaMaker`, `AIScafoldrSchemaMaker` (schema generated by AI), etc.

Includes `_create_names()` utility that generates multiple naming formats (camel_case, pascal_case, kebab_case, snake_case) with both singular and plural variations using the `inflect` library for accurate pluralization. These various name formats are stored directly in the schema objects, making templating easier by eliminating the need for generators to handle case conversions.

## Usage Flow

1. Input (DBML) → DBML Schema Maker → ScafoldrSchema
2. ScafoldrSchema → Code Generators → Generated Code

## Naming System

All entities and attributes include a `Names` object with multiple case formats:
- **camel_case**: `user` / `users`
- **pascal_case**: `User` / `Users`
- **kebab_case**: `user` / `users`
- **snake_case**: `user` / `users`

Each format includes both singular and plural variations, stored directly in the schema for easy template access.

## Purpose

Provides a consistent data structure that separates input parsing from code generation, allowing generators to focus on templating without handling different input formats or case conversions.
